This repository contains a MATLAB function that exhibits unexpected behavior when the input is zero. The function includes an `if-else` statement to handle different input values, but it lacks proper error handling for the case when the input is zero, leading to division by zero. The solution demonstrates a way to add error handling to address this issue and prevent unexpected results.
